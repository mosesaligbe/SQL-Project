# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to find patterns in the product type in relation to the visitor’s city, country, time they visited, and time the visitor’s spent on the site while acquiring the products.

## Process
First, exploratory data analysis was performed, where the raw dataset was examined along with its variables.
Then proper data cleaning was performed to eliminate incorrect/bias analysis.

## Results
I was able to find some distinct patterns between the product types and the city, country the visitor lives.

## Challenges 
The values stored in the raw dataset was really unorganized, it took me some time transforming data to be adeqaute for the analysis

## Future Goals
I would like to explore the dataset more to know if they are other variables that might affects the pattern seen. 
Also In the future I could give myself more time to get comfortable with many of the skills required to complete the project beforehand. rather than trying to figure out how to tackle a certain step without understanding what I'm supposed to do.
